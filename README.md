# Task Vanquisher App

## About this App 
This is a task tracking application designed in the KanBan board style. Users can add new tasks, move a task into the "In Progress" section, and when completed (or vanquished!) move the task into the "Completed" section.
This app was originally created for University of Penn Full Stack Coding Bootcamp coursework, with further updates made after the coursework was completed.
